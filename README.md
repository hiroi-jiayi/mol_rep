# mol_rep
Chemical representations of molecules (fingerprints and voxel-based approach) combined with random forest regressor for predicting drug potency (pXC50)


Several molecular representations were explored here, including fingerprints (Morgan, RDKit, MACCS, phamacophore) and voxel-based representations. The task was to compare the predictive ability of these representations in drug discovery appliations. Dataset used in this project was described in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-017-5685-x under Section: Baseline QSAR datasets. The quantity of interest here is the pXC50 value.
